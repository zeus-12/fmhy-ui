            Our goal is to spread free education and entertainment to as many
            people as we can, and fight for the rights of those who feel left
            behind to be happy, educated, and comfortable, despite their
            economic circumstances.
            <br /> We want to show people what the world could look like if we
            started treating everyone as equally deserving of all things good.
            To organize, index and preserve as many sites and as much content as
            we possibly can, both for people now and people in the future.
            <br /> We want to do our best to lead by example, and prove that
            putting others before ourselves really does make the world a better
            place.

            to happen to me, it would be in good hands thanks to the awesome
            mods in discord. I just wanted to say this because sometimes
            projects like this end up slowly dying, and that isn't going to
            happen with us.

            Giving as many people as possible access to educational material and
            entertainment does make the world a smarter and happier place.
