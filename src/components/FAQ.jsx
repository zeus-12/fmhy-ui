    answer:
      "Posting has always been off to keep the chances of the sub surviving as high as possible. Our main focus is the Wiki, which has grown to include nearly 30k links. It's 100% alive, and gets updated daily. For a discussion sub, check out r/Piracy.",

    question: "Are the sites here safe to use?",

      "Yes, we always scan files and research sites before adding them. We also listen to the community, so if there's something you feel needs to be addressed you're more than welcome to contact us.",

    question: "How can I contact you?",

    question: "Can I edit FMHY?",

    question: "Can I download FMHY?",

    question: "Why is there no NSFW section?",

    question: "Divolt isn't loading, what should I do?",
    answer:
      "If the page won't load, try clearing your cache, a different browser, disabling ublock, using incognito or the desktop / mobile apps. During signup you can use a fake email, but it will only load with real domains like .gmail.",

    question: "Can I donate?",
