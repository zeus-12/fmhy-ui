Tasks todo with Priority order!

- add mantine spotlight for search
- use react query for data fetching!
- update fmhy.ml/links with the github scraped one
- fix the notification, dont do manual timeouts.

- standard font size/ padding/margin, colours, etc
- write scraper for STORAGE and base64
- fix the auth -> react 18 broke it -> maybe shift to next(pain!!: express server + nextauth would be hard to manage --> research) or just plain jwt

- search using the links, (and not just the title),
- maybe increase the width of menucomponent?

- try : instead of passing {...props} to the component, instead pass only required props : may have performance improvements.
