Tasks todo with Priority order!

- use react query/swr for data fetching!

- fix the auth -> react 18 broke it -> maybe shift to next(pain!!: express server + nextauth would be hard to manage --> research) or just plain jwt

- try : instead of passing {...props} to the component, instead pass only required props : may have performance improvements.
